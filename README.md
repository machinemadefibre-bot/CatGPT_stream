MimicGate turns logged-in browser sessions into standard, developer-friendly API endpoints. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini operate through a persistent, stealth-automated browser context; MiniMax uses its official API while sharing the exact same gateway interface. It is designed for private, self-hosted developer integrations, local coding agents, and home labs.

## Fork vs Upstream

Both projects share the foundational browser gateway concept: ChatGPT and Claude support, OpenAI Chat Completions, basic tool calling, vision inputs, multi-tab concurrency, and Docker deployment.

MimicGate adds extensive multi-protocol support, provider coverage, and resilience enhancements:

| Capability | MimicGate (This Repository) | Upstream (CatGPT-Gateway) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Google Gemini Provider** | ✅ Browser-backed with Imagen 3 and TTS | - |
| **MiniMax Provider** | ✅ Official API integration | - |
| **OpenAI Responses API** (`/v1/responses`) | ✅ Full input/output conversion | - |
| **Anthropic Messages Adapter** (`/v1/messages`) | ✅ Full schema translation | - |

> [!TIP]
> Long-prompt fallback is enabled by default. If a provider disables direct submission for oversized text, MimicGate automatically uploads the prompt losslessly as a temporary UTF-8 Markdown attachment. This flow has been validated with requests exceeding 1.4 million characters.

> [!NOTE]
> For the ChatGPT browser provider, `stream=true` forwards live user-facing text from ChatGPT's `/backend-api/conversation` SSE stream. Responses streams open immediately with a short `thinking...` reasoning-summary item and periodic keep-alive comments while the model is still reasoning. Structured tool calls are emitted after the completed payload is validated; other providers may still complete before emitting streaming chunks.

> [!TIP]
> On ChatGPT tool/function requests, MimicGate externalizes everything before `Latest request to transform:` into a temporary Markdown attachment. The browser composer receives only a short attachment pointer plus the latest request, preserving the full original context without pasting the large first-turn tool/system prefix into the composer.

## Providers

MimicGate abstracts multiple frontier AI providers behind a single uniform interface:

| Provider | Mechanism | Primary Model ID | Capabilities and Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | Persistent browser | `mimicgate-browser` (or `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.5`, etc.) | Vision, file attachments, DALL-E image generation, read-aloud TTS capture, reasoning effort control (`low`/`medium`/`high`), project confinement (`CHATGPT_PROJECT_URL`). |
| **Claude** | Persistent browser | `claude-browser` (or `claude-3-7-sonnet`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`) | Conversational turns, vision, file attachments, structured tool calling. |
| **Gemini** | Persistent browser | `gemini-browser` (or `gemini-3.8-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro`, etc.) | Text chat, vision, file attachments, Imagen 3 image generation, read-aloud audio capture, thinking/reasoning effort modes. |
| **MiniMax** | Official API | `MiniMax-M2.7` | Pure HTTP API proxy providing fast, non-browser completions using official provider credentials. |

---

## Parallelization and Tab Lifecycle

MimicGate manages browser concurrency through a dedicated `BrowserTabPool` coordinator, allowing multiple requests to execute in parallel without cross-session interference:

```
Incoming Request
    │
    ├─ Has session identity? (x-session-id, conversation_id, app_key)
    │     │
    │     ├─ YES: Acquire session-specific lock (serializes turns for that thread)
    │     │       Reuse existing tab OR open new worker tab and restore URL
    │     │
    │     └─ NO (Stateless / Fresh mode):
    │             Borrow idle tab from ephemeral pool OR open new worker tab
    │             Reset tab to provider base URL -> execute turn -> return to pool
    │
    └─ Bounded by MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS semaphore (global concurrency cap)
```

### When are tabs reused vs created?

* **Tab Reuse (Session Affinity)**:
  When a request provides an identity (`x-session-id`, `session-id`, `x-mimicgate-app-key`, `conversation_id`, or `thread_id`), the gateway maps the request to a persistent tab dedicated to that session. The tab stays parked on the provider conversation URL, eliminating unnecessary page navigations between conversational turns.
* **New Tab Creation**:
  A new browser tab is created when a new session key arrives and no existing tab is mapped to it, or when all ephemeral tabs are busy and the system has not reached `MAX_ACTIVE_TABS`.
* **Tab Eviction and Capacity Management**:
  When active tabs reach `MAX_ACTIVE_TABS`, the pool frees resources using a clean lifecycle:
  1. It discards and closes idle ephemeral tabs first.
  2. If more space is required, it evicts idle persistent tabs using an LRU (least recently used) policy.
  3. When evicting an idle persistent tab, MimicGate saves the conversation URL so that subsequent turns for that session can reopen a tab and navigate directly back to the active thread.
* **Control Page Protection**:
  The primary browser tab (`__control__`) used for initial login and manual supervision is permanently protected and never closed by eviction routines.

---

## Thread Management and Conversation Continuity

MimicGate offers flexible ways to manage conversation state across stateless API clients and stateful browser sessions:

### Same-Thread Continuity
* **Durable ID Mapping**: Providing `conversation_id` (or the `X-MimicGate-Conversation-Id` header) binds the request to a tracked provider thread.
* **Composer Deduplication Optimization**: When continuing an existing thread, MimicGate inspects the message array and extracts only the system prompts plus the latest user turn and tool outputs (`_latest_turn_messages`). Because the browser thread already holds the previous dialog history, resending the entire transcript is omitted, preventing composer bloat and saving model context.

### Separate and Isolated Threads
* **App-Scoped Route Isolation**: Use routes prefixed with an application name, such as `/{app_name}/v1/chat/completions` (e.g. `/cline/v1/...` or `/openwebui/v1/...`). Each application namespace maintains isolated conversation state and thread contracts, preventing different tools from colliding.
* **Explicit Thread Targeting**: Clients can pass `thread_id` directly in the payload to force execution on a specific existing provider thread.
* **Fresh / Ephemeral Mode**: Sending `X-MimicGate-Thread-Mode: fresh` forces the gateway to initiate a brand-new, isolated thread that is automatically cleaned up and deleted after response delivery.

---

## Multimodal and Image Handling

MimicGate supports comprehensive vision, file upload, and image generation flows:

### 1. Vision and File Attachments (Input)
* **Standard Formats**: Supports standard OpenAI multimodal message format (`image_url` with remote `http(s)://` URLs or inline `data:image/...;base64,...` data URIs).
* **Document Uploads**: In addition to images, document attachments (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.py`, `.csv`, `.json`, etc.) can be attached to prompts.
* **Secure Staging**: Inbound remote URLs and base64 payloads are securely staged in temporary local storage (`/tmp/mimicgate_files` or platform temporary directories), uploaded to the provider hidden file inputs via Playwright `set_input_files()`, monitored until the provider UI completes upload processing, and cleaned up immediately after request completion.
* **Structured Multipage Extraction**: Includes an optional page-by-page document extraction mode that normalizes multi-page documents into structured JSON schema outputs.

### 2. Image Generation (Output)
* **Endpoints**: Exposes standard OpenAI `/v1/images/generations` endpoints.
* **Engines**: Routes prompts directly to ChatGPT (DALL-E) or Gemini (Imagen 3).
* **Extraction**: Monitors the DOM for rendered image artifacts, extracts high-resolution generated media, and returns them as either URLs or base64 encoded strings (`b64_json`).

---

## Backwards Compatibility

MimicGate is a direct evolution of the CatGPT project. Existing client setups and scripts continue to work without changes:

* The legacy `catgpt-browser` model ID is accepted and maps directly to `mimicgate-browser`.
* Custom headers `x-catgpt-app-key`, `x-catgpt-conversation-id`, and `x-catgpt-thread-mode` remain supported, with `x-mimicgate-*` taking precedence when both are supplied.
* The `catgpt` CLI command and `CatGPTApp` class import remain functional aliases.
* Legacy environment variables (`CATGPT_API_URL`, `CATGPT_API_KEY`, `CATGPT_MODEL`, etc.) are recognized as fallbacks when `MIMICGATE_*` variables are not defined.
